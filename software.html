  <h1>Background story</h1>
  <p>Before we developed this software, it took a long time to write HTML documents such as tables of our lab notes. Because not all of us are good at HTML works, one or two HTML experts in our team did all works. We thought how wonderful it would be if we could assign this work to other members in our team. </p>

  <h2>Consistency</h2>
  <p>You don't have to worry about syntax errors. All files generated by KELN are formatted in the same way, including class tags for custormizing their appearance.</p>
